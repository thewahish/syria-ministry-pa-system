# Syria Ministry PA System - Project Status

**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Current Phase:** Complete Website Redesign - Separate Language Pages

## ✅ **Completed Work**

### Phase 1: Initial Development
- ✅ Complete technical analysis and package development
- ✅ Bilingual website infrastructure
- ✅ Technical study document creation
- ✅ Digital Ocean deployment guide
- ✅ All relative paths configured

### Phase 2: Troubleshooting & Redesign
- ✅ Identified language toggle system issues
- ✅ Moved all previous HTML files to `OLD/` folder for archive
- ✅ Decided to redesign with separate English/Arabic pages

## 🔄 **Current Status: In Progress**

### **Problem Identified:**
Complex JavaScript language toggle system was not working reliably. Arabic content wasn't displaying despite toggle functionality working.

### **Solution Approach:**
Complete redesign with **separate HTML files for each language**:
- `index-en.html` / `index-ar.html`  
- `technical-study-en.html` / `technical-study-ar.html`
- `equipment-specs-en.html` / `equipment-specs-ar.html`
- etc.

## 📋 **Next Steps (Priority Order)**

### **Immediate Tasks:**
1. **Create separate English and Arabic HTML pages** for each document
2. **Research current 2025 equipment pricing and images**
3. **Calculate shipping costs to Syria by container ship**
4. **Estimate container space requirements for equipment**
5. **Create simple navigation system between language versions**
6. **Verify all relative paths work correctly**

### **Key Requirements for Next Session:**
1. **Equipment Research:**
   - Current 2025 pricing for Sennheiser, QSC, Audio-Technica equipment
   - High-quality product images from manufacturer websites
   - Updated specifications and availability

2. **Shipping Logistics:**
   - Container shipping rates to Syria (Sea freight)
   - Space requirements estimation (cubic meters)
   - Syria import duties and restrictions
   - Full container vs shared container analysis

3. **Website Structure:**
   - Clean, separate pages for each language
   - Simple language switching (just links between pages)
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Professional appearance for government use
